	          <h2>Background</h2>
	          <p> Tezuka is a fictional character in the manga and anime series The Prince of Tennis created by Takeshi Konomi, who described Tezuka as the character who he has the least in common with. He is introduced as the strict and serious captain of Seishun Academy's tennis team who enforces order within his team, often making its members run laps. With his all-around tennis style and advanced techniques, Tezuka is considered to be a National-level tennis player by many of the other characters.</p>

	          <h2>Personality and Hobbies</h2>
	          <p>Tezuka is always serious about everything he does, especially when it comes to his duties as the captain of the tennis team. Despite being very strict, he is fair and sticks to his word. He is determined to lead his team to the Nationals Champions, which often results in him ignoring his doctor's warnings against him playing in arduous tennis matches -risking re-injury in his matches to ensure their victory. In the tennis team, he is viewed as team's "pillar of support.

	          <p>
             As the captain of Seishun Academy's tennis club, Tezuka is the one to give Ryoma a chance to become a regular on the team. Despite being known as Seigaku's "strongest man", he initially remains on the sidelines during tournaments as another teammate sometimes play his position or their opponent is defeated too early. Though he secretly challenges and defeats Ryoma in an unofficial match, his true skills are first shown during a match against Sadaharu Inui. During the Kanto tournament first-round match against Hyotei's captain, Keigo Atobe, the pain from an old arm injury returns, and though he refuses to give up, the game ends with Atobe's win. In order to receive medical treatment for his injuries, Tezuka goes to Germany. He returns right before the National Tournament, where he unseals a technique that he used to use before his injury to defeat Higa Junior High's captain, Eishiro Kite, in the first match, and then goes on to defeat Hyotei Academy's Munehiro Kabaji in his next match. In the semi-finals, Tezuka plays one-on-one against Shitenhoji's Senri Chitose despite it being a doubles match, and after unveiling two new techniques, Tezuka emerges victorious.
